# Predicting Timely Adoption and Optimizing Adoption Channels for Shelter Animals
## DSC 630 - Predictive Analytics - Final Project

The objective is to identify the potential use of predictive analytics, formulate the problem, identify the right sources of data, analyze data, and prescribe actions to improve not only the process of decision making but also the outcome of decisions. 

### Abstract
In areas where pet overpopulation is high, the rate at which animals are entering shelters greatly outweighs the number of animals leaving through permanent adoption, temporary fostering or transport outside of the region. Despite the extraordinary efforts of the animal welfare community, euthanasia is often unavoidable, especially in areas of the South where many pet owners have not adopted the spay and neuter practice for their pets. The objective of this project is to determine if taking a closer look at shelter data and animal characteristics can not only predict the likelihood that an animal will be adopted out quickly, but also direct shelter managers to make subtle changes that will decrease the length of stay for animals and effectively route them through the best adoption channel.
